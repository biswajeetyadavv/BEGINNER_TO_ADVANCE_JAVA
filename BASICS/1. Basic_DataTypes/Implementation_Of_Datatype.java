//        TYPES OF DATATYPE AND THERE USE.

        int a = 34;
//        in (int) we store data or value which are
//        integers. in simple values without decimal and
//        small in size.

        double b = 23.4;
//        basically, in (double) also known as float.
//        here we store value which are in decimal.

        boolean c = (23 != 24);
//        in (boolean) we put values which is a kind of conditon
//        like it could be true or false.
//        this datatype doesn't returs any int or double value but
//        it reture vlaue in true or false.
//        after, analysing the condition.

        long d = 213556667777L;
//        in (long) we put values which we can't store in (int).
//        means values which large in size.
//        note the at last we have "L" because it indicates it's a
//        (long) value.





//        USES OF ARITHMETIC, RELATIONAL , AND LOGICAL OPERATORS EFFECTIVELY.

//        ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
//        its basically mathmaticall operators
//        such as i. addintion, ii. subtraction, iii. multiplication
//        iv. division

        int value1 = 23;
        int value2 = 34;

//        ADDITION
        int sum = value1 + value2;

//        SUBTRACTION
        int sub = value1 - value2;

//        multiplication
        int multi = value1 * value2;

//        DIVITION
        int divition = value1/value2;
